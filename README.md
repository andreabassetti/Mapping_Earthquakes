# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose: 

The purpose of this challenge is to help Basil and Sadhana create a map that shows the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. They would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map and have the optionality to swith between map types. Below are the three maps and the menu that shows all of the maps optionalities.
